**2. Verdicts:**

*   Claim 1: True
*   Claim 2: Unverifiable
*   Claim 3: Unverifiable
*   Claim 4: Unverifiable

**3. Additional Context and Background Information:**

*   **Krishna:** Krishna is a major deity in Hinduism. He is revered as the eighth avatar of Vishnu and is central to the Vaishnavism tradition. Krishna's stories involve him as a playful child, a cowherd, a divine lover, and a warrior-king. His association with cows and cowherding is a recurring theme in his legends. The Blue Skin represents the infinite and the all pervading.
*   **Tilak:** A tilak is a mark worn on the forehead, typically made with colored powder or paste. It can signify religious affiliation, auspiciousness, or simply be decorative. In the context of a Krishna depiction, it would likely have religious significance.

**4. Assessment of Authenticity (If Applicable):**

*   Based on the description (cartoonish, digitally created), the image is likely a digital illustration rather than a photograph of a real-life event. Because it depicts a deity in a fantastical context, authenticity is less about verifying a real event and more about assessing whether the depiction aligns with generally accepted artistic and religious conventions surrounding Krishna. The description suggests it does align with those conventions.
